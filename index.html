            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>What is a web developer?</h4>
            In short, a web developer is someone whose profession is to create and make a
            website work, but in reality, web development is much more than that. There are three main types of
            web
            developers: front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers. First, I will talk about the most known
            type
            of developers, front-end workers. Front-end coders normally create websites using three different
            coding
            languages : HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS).
            Front-end developers are responsible for the design of the website and they are often confused as
            the
            only people responsible for making a website. Using HTML and CSS they create all of the parts that a
            user sees on a website such as the buttons, text, and images and using JS, they make all of the
            buttons
            and interactive elements of a website work. Next, the back end-developers. Back-end web developers
            are
            responsible for doing all of the things that you do not see or in other words, they work on the
            server-side of things. Databases are often used by back-end developers as they are really important
            for
            almost all websites because they store all of the information such as the reviews on an Amazon
            product
            or the temperature on the weather app. Back-end engineers are responsible for creating the databases
            and
            the information in them as well as that, they are also managing the servers and making sure that the
            front-end, servers, and databases are all able to communicate with each other smoothly. Finally,
            there
            are full-stack web developers which are basically experts in both front-end and back-end therefore
            leading them to often get a higher salary than other web developers.

            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>What education required for a web developer?</h4>
            While it is possible to get a job in web-development without getting a degree, it is common nowadays
            for employers to require you to have
            at least a Bachelor Degree in computer science, coding, and degrees in a similar field.

            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>What is the salary range for web developers?</h4>
            Salary in web development, as in all fields, varies based on factors such as experience and
            employer. The type of web
            developer also plays a role in determining pay, with full-stack developers typically earning more on
            average than back-end and front-end developers. According to Xello, the average salary of a junior
            web
            developer is between $40,000 - $50,000, the average salary of an intermediate developer is between
            $50,000 - $80,000, and the average salary of a senior web developer/ project manager is between
            $70,000
            - $110,000. Salaries can go even higher for really advanced coders that have many years of
            experience.

            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>The future possibilities</h4>
            Web development is a very future-proof job because while AI is getting better at making websites,
            they
            will never be as good as humans. Because plenty of companies are now switching to online stores, web
            developers have been in high demand and the demand for them will almost never go down because every
            day
            there are new companies looking for web developers to make them a website.

            <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>Why I would like to be a web developer</h4>
            Being a web developer is currently the job I am looking to pursue in my future career because both
            of my parents work as web
            developers. Another reason why I would like to be a web developer is because they can work from
            anywhere
            they want including their home. I also enjoy coding and designing websites which all together makes
            web
            development a perfect job for me.

        <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>Information about the university I chose</h4>

        The school I will be focusing on is Carleton University. Carleton University was founded about 81 years ago
        and it is situated in Ottawa, Ontario.<br> Overall, Carleton University is ranked number 526 in Best Global
        Universities and 20th in Best Global Universities in Canada. <br>

        <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>Entrance Requirements</h4>
        The minimum grade cut-off range (which is the academic average for admission in a program) is 85-88%. As
        mentioned previously, most people recommended
        getting a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science if aspire to be a web developer. <br>To enter the computer
        science program in Carleton University you must obviously have an Ontario Secondary School Diploma as well
        as at least six completed 4U or M courses with no mark below 60%. Two of the six 4U or M courses have to be
        Advanced Functions, and Calculus and Vectors.
        <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>Things necessary to pass the course</h4>
        Students must get higher than a C- in their course or else no credits will be awarded to them.
        Tuition for the Computer Science program is $9,124 and other mandatory fees
        are $1,237 making the total cost for a full year $10,361.
        <h4 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px" ;>Time it takes to finish the course</h4>
        Like most other Bachelor Degrees, it takes 4 years
        to complete the program and get the degree.
